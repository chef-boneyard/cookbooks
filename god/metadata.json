  "long_description": "= DESCRIPTION:\n\nInstalls god gem, sets up modular configuration directory and provides a define to monitor processes.\n\n= REQUIREMENTS:\n\n== Platform and Application Environment:\n\nTested on Ubuntu 8.10. May work on other platforms, esp Ubuntu/Debian. Sample configuration file uses mongrel_runit for managing mongrels via runit. \n\n== Cookbooks:\n\nOpscode cookbooks, http://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/tree/master:\n\n* ruby\n* runit\n\nOpscode does not yet have a mongrel_runit cookbook.\n\n= ATTRIBUTES: \n\nNo attributes are used.\n\n= USAGE:\n\nThis recipe is designed to be used through the god_monitor define. Create a god configuration file in your application's cookbook and then call god_monitor:\n\n  god_monitor \"myproj\" do\n    config \"myproj.god.erb\"\n  end\n\nA sample mongrel.god.erb is provided, though it assumes mongrel_runit is used. This can be used as a baseline for customization.\n\n= LICENSE and AUTHOR:\n      \nAuthor:: Joshua Timberman (<joshua@opscode.com>)\nCopyright:: 2009, Opscode, Inc\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
