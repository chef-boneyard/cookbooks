Description
===========

Installs subversion for clients or sets up a server under Apache HTTPD.

Requirements
============

## Platforms:

* Debian/Ubuntu
* RHEL/CentOS
* Fedora
* Windows

## Cookbooks:

* apache2
* windows

Attributes
==========

See `attributes/default.rb` for default values. The attributes are
used in the server recipe.

* `node['subversion']['repo_dir']` - filesystem location of the
  repository to serve.
* `node['subversion']['repo_name']` - name of the repository to serve up.
* `node['subversion']['server_name']` - server name used in the svn vhost.
* `node['subversion']['user']` - user to log into the svn vhost.
* `node['subversion']['password']` - htpasswd for the subversion user
  in the server recipe. This should be overridden as the default is
  not secure.


Recipes
=======

default
-------

Includes `recipe[subversion::client]`.

client
------

Installs `subversion` packages.

server
------

Sets up an SVN repository server with `recipe[apache2::mod_dav_svn]`.
This will use the `web_app` definition from the apache cookbook to
drop off the template, and uses the attributes for configuration.

Usage
=====

On nodes where `subversion` should be installed such as application
servers that will check out a repository, use `recipe[subversion]`. If
you would like a subversion server, use `recipe[subversion::server]`.
You should override `node['subversion']['password']` in the role that
applies the server recipe.

Changes
=======

## v1.0.0:

* [COOK-810] - add Windows platform support

## v0.8.3:

* Current public release
