Description
===========

Provides a set of primitives for managing firewalls and associated rules.

PLEASE NOTE - The resource/providers in this cookbook are under heavy development.
An attempt is being made to keep the resource simple/stupid by starting with less 
sophisticated firewall implementations first and refactor/vet the resource definition 
with each successive provider.

Requirements
============

Platform
--------

* Ubuntu

Tested on:

* Ubuntu 10.04
* Ubuntu 11.04

Resources/Providers
===================

`firewall`
----------

### Actions

- :enable: enable the firewall.  this will make any rules that have been defined 'active'.
- :disable: disable the firewall. drop any rules and put the node in an unprotected state.

### Attribute Parameters

- name: name attribute. arbitrary name to uniquely identify this resource

### Providers

- `Chef::Provider::Firewall::Ufw`
    - platform default: Ubuntu

### Examples
    
    # enable platform default firewall
    firewall "ufw" do
      action :enable
    end

`firewall_rule`
---------------

### Actions

- :allow: the rule should allow incoming traffic.
- :deny: the rule should deny incoming traffic

### Attribute Parameters

- name: name attribute. arbitrary name to uniquely identify this firewall rule
- protocol: valid values are: :udp, :tcp. default is all protocols
- port: port number.
- source: ip address or subnet incoming traffic originates from. default is `0.0.0.0/0` (ie Anywhere)
- destination: ip address or subnet traffic routing to
- position: position to insert rule at. if not provided rule is inserted at the end of the rule list.

### Providers

- `Chef::Provider::FirewallRule::Ufw`
    - platform default: Ubuntu

### Examples

    # open standard ssh port, enable firewall
    firewall_rule "ssh" do
      port 22
      action :allow
      notifies :enable, "firewall[ufw]"
    end
    
    # open standard http port to tcp traffic only; insert as first rule; enable firewall
    firewall_rule "http" do
      port 80
      protocol :tcp
      position 1
      action :allow
      notifies :enable, "firewall[ufw]"
    end
    
    firewall "ufw" do
      action :nothing
    end

Changes/Roadmap
===============

## Future

* [COOK-688] create iptables providers for all resources
* [COOK-689] create windows firewall providers for all resources
* [COOK-690] create firewall_chain resource
* [COOK-693] create pf firewall providers for all resources

## 0.5.2

* add missing 'requires' statements. fixes 'NameError: uninitialized constant' error.  
thanks to Ernad HusremoviÄ‡ for the fix.

## 0.5.0

* [COOK-686] create firewall and firewall_rule resources
* [COOK-687] create UFW providers for all resources
