= DESCRIPTION:

Creates users with authorized_keys.

= REQUIREMENTS:

Data bag named "users" must exist. See USAGE.

= USAGE:

This cookbook is specific for setting up sysadmin group and users for now.

    include_recipe "users::sysadmins"

Use knife to create a data bag for users.

    knife data bag create users

Create a user.

    knife data bag create users bofh

Then paste the following in the $EDITOR window that opens (editing where required)

    {
      "id": "bofh",
      "ssh_keys": "",
      "groups": "sysadmin",
      "uid": 2001,
      "shell": "\/bin\/bash",
      "comment": "BOFH",
      "nagios": {
        "pager": "8005551212@txt.att.net",
        "email": "bofh@example.com"
      },
      "openid": "bofh.myopenid.com"
    }

Paste the user's public SSH key into the ssh_keys value. Also make sure the uid is unique, and if you're not using bash, that the shell is installed. Group must be sysadmin.

The recipe will also create the sysadmin group. If you're using the opscode sudo cookbook, they'll have sudo access in the default site-cookbooks template. They won't have passwords though, so the sudo cookbook's template needs to be adjusted so the sysadmin group has NOPASSWD.
