See USAGE.\n\n= USAGE:\n\nThis cookbook is specific for setting up sysadmin group and users for now.\n\n    include_recipe \"users::sysadmins\"\n\nUse knife to create a data bag for users.\n\n    knife create_data --bag=users\n\nCreate a user.\n\n    knife create_item --bag=users --id bofh\n    {\n      \"id\": \"bofh\",\n      \"ssh_keys\": \"\",\n      \"groups\": \"sysadmin\",\n      \"uid\": 2001,\n      \"shell\": \"\\/bin\\/bash\",\n      \"comment\": \"BOFH\",\n      \"nagios\": {\n        \"pager\": \"8005551212@txt.att.net\",\n        \"email\": \"bofh@example.com\"\n      },\n      \"openid\": \"bofh.myopenid.com\"\n    }\n\nPaste the user's public SSH key into the ssh_keys value. Also make sure the uid is unique, and if you're not using bash, that the shell is installed. Group must be sysadmin.\n\nThe recipe will also create the sysadmin group. If you're using the opscode sudo cookbook, they'll have sudo access in the default site-cookbooks template. They won't have passwords though, so the sudo cookbook's template needs to be adjusted so the sysadmin group has NOPASSWD.\n\n= LICENSE and AUTHOR:\n\nAuthor:: Joshua Timberman (<joshua@opscode.com>)\n\nCopyright:: 2009, Opscode, Inc\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n"
