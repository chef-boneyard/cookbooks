      customer node[:dynect][:customer]
      username node[:dynect][:username]
      password node[:dynect][:password]
      zone     node[:dynect][:zone]
    end

RECIPES
=======

This cookbook provides the following recipes.

default
-------

The default recipe installs Adam Jacob's `dynect_rest` gem during the Chef run's compile time to ensure it is available in the same run as utilizing the `dynect_rr` resource/provider.

ec2
---

**Only use this recipe on Amazon AWS EC2 hosts!**

The `dynect::ec2` recipe provides an example of working with the Dyn API with EC2 instances. It creates CNAME records based on the EC2 instance ID (`node.ec2.instance_id`), and a constructed hostname from the dynect.ec2 attributes.

The recipe also edits resolv.conf to search compute-1.internal and the dynect.domain and use dynect.domain as the default domain, and it will set the nodes hostname per the DNS settings.

a_record
--------

The `dynect::a_record` recipe will create an `A` record for the node using the detected hostname and IP address from `ohai`.
