= DESCRIPTION:

Installs memcached and provides a define to set up an instance of memcache via runit.

= REQUIREMENTS:

== Platform:

Tested on Ubuntu 8.10-9.10. Uses the memcached init script by default. A runit service can be set up for instances using the included define.

== Cookbooks:

Opscode cookbooks, http://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/tree/master:

* runit

= ATTRIBUTES: 

The following are node attributes passed to the template for the runit service.

* memcached[:memory] - maximum memory for memcached instances.
* memcached[:user] - user to run memcached as.
* memcached[:port] - port for memcached to listen on.
* memcached[:listen] - IP address for memcached to listen on.

= USAGE:

Simply set the attributes and it will configure the /etc/memcached.conf file. If you want to use multiple memcached instances, you'll need to modify the recipe to disable the startup script and the template in the default recipe.

Use the define, memcached_instance, to set up a runit service for the named memcached instance.

  memcached_instance "myproj" 

The recipe also reads in whether to start up memcached from a /etc/default/memcached "ENABLE_MEMCACHED" setting, which is "yes" by default.
