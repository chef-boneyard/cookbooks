Description
===========

Configures a tftpd server for serving Ubuntu installers over PXE and setting them to run a provided preseed.cfg.

Requirements
============

Written and last tested with Chef 0.10.0 and Ubuntu 10.04.

Attributes
==========

Attributes under the `pxe_dust` namespace.

* `["pxe_dust"]["arch"]` - Architecture of the netboot.tar.gz to use as the source of pxeboot images.
* `["pxe_dust"]["version"]` - Ubuntu version of the netboot.tar.gz to use as the source of pxeboot images.
* `["pxe_dust"]["user"]["fullname"]` - Full name of the default user, default "Ubuntu".
* `["pxe_dust"]["user"]["username"]` - Username of the default user, default "ubuntu".
* `["pxe_dust"]["user"]["crypted_password"]` - SHA512 password for the default user, default nil. This must be generated and added as an attribute or you won't be able to login.

Templates
=========

syslinux.cfg.erb
----------------

Sets the boot prompt to automatically run the installer.

txt.cfg.erb
-----------

Sets the URL to the preseed file.

preseed.cfg.erb
---------------

The preseed file is full of opinions, you will want to update this. If there is a node providing an apt-cacher proxy via the `[apt::cacher]` recipe, it is provided in the preseed.cfg.

Recipes
=======

Default
-------

The default recipe passes through to `pxe_dust::server`.

Server
------

The server includes the `apache2` and `tftp::server` recipes.

The recipe does the following:

1. Downloads the proper netboot.tar.gz to boot from.
2. Untars it to the `[:tftp][:directory]` directory.
3. Instructs the installer prompt to automatically install.
4. Passes the URL of the preseed.cfg to the installer.
5. Uses the preseed.cfg template to pass in any `apt-cacher` proxies.

Usage
=====

Create a role, `pxe_server`.

    name "pxe_server"
    description "PXE Dust Boot Server"
    run_list("recipe[pxe_dust::server]")
    default_attributes(
      "pxe_dust" => {
        "user" => {
          "username" => "ubuntu",
          "fullname" => "Ubuntu",
          "crypted_password" => "$6$Trby4Y5R$bi90k7uYY5ImXe5MWGFW9kel2BnMCcYO9EnwngTFIXKG2/nWcLKTJZ3verMFnpFbITI9.eHwZ.HR1UPeKbCAV1"
    )

On an Ubuntu system, the password can be generated by installing the `mkpasswd` package and running:

    mkpasswd -m sha-512

The example above is the hash of the password `ubuntu`, if you'd like to test. This attribute must be set to a valid sha-512 hash of the password or you will not be able to log in.

This cookbook does not provide DHCP or bootp to listen for PXE boot requests, this URL will have to be provided by another cookbook or manually. The author had to do this manually on a DD-WRT router.

Side note, for DD-WRT bootp support [this forum post was followed](http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=4662). The key syntax was

    dhcp-boot=pxelinux.0,,192.168.1.147

in the section `Additional DNSMasq Options` where the IP address is that of the tftpd server we're configuring here and pxelinux.0 is from the netboot tarball.
