Description
===========
This is a cookbook for managing RabbitMQ with Chef.  It uses the default settings, but can also be configured via attributes.

Recipes
=======
default
-------
Installs `rabbitmq-server` from RabbitMQ.com's APT repository or the RPM directly (there is no yum repo). The distribution-provided versions were quite old and newer features were needed.

Cluster recipe is now combined with default. Recipe will now auto-cluster. Set the :cluster attribute to true, :cluster_disk_nodes array of `node@host` strings that describe which you want to be disk nodes and then set an alphanumeric string for the :erlang_cookie. 

To enable SSL turn :ssl to true and set the paths to your cacert, cert and key files.

Resources/Providers
===================
There are 2 LWRPs for interacting with RabbitMQ.

user
----
Adds and deletes users, fairly simplistic permissions management.

- `:add` adds a `user` with a `password`
- `:delete` deletes a `user`
- `:set_permissions` sets the `permissions` for a `user`, `vhost` is optional
- `:clear_permissions` clears the permissions for a `user`

### Examples
``` ruby
rabbitmq_user "guest" do
  action :delete
end

rabbitmq_user "nova" do
  password "sekret"
  action :add
end

rabbitmq_user "nova" do
  vhost "/nova"
  permissions "\".*\" \".*\" \".*\""
  action :set_permissions
end
```

vhost
-----
Adds and deletes vhosts.

- `:add` adds a `vhost`
- `:delete` deletes a `vhost`

### Example
``` ruby
rabbitmq_vhost "/nova" do
  action :add
end
```

Limitations
===========
For an already running cluster, these actions still require manual intervention:
- changing the :erlang_cookie 
- turning :cluster from true to false

The rabbitmq::chef recipe was only used for the chef-server cookbook and has been moved to chef-server::rabbitmq.

Changes
=======

## v1.3.2:
* [COOK-585] - manage rabbitmq-server service
