Description
===========

Installs Gecode 3.5.0+ development package.

Requirements
============

Tested on Ubuntu and Debian with Opscode APT repository and build from source.

Tested on CentOS for build from source. See USAGE for information on installing RPMs.

Requires the following cookbooks:

* apt - for installing packages from apt.opscode.com
* build-essential - for compiling from source

Usage
=====

The recipe is primarily used to install gecode's development package or from source in order to install the `dep_selector` gem, which needs to compile native extensions.

Note that compiling gecode takes a long time, up to ~30 minutes on a 4 core Macbook Pro.

On Debian and Ubuntu systems, the recipe will attempt to install packages from apt.opscode.com. It uses the apt repository LWRP in Opscode's apt cookbook to enable the repository.  For releases after Debian 7.0 (Wheezy) and Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty), Gecode 3.5.0+ exists in the main repositories.

On Red Hat family distros, the recipe will attempt to install gecode from source. To install using a package the recipe needs to be updated to account for a package repository. Implementation varies depending on the package repository. For example, to retrieve the /etc/yum.repos.d/somewhere.repo that has the package available, add a condition to the main 'if' block:

    remote_file "/etc/yum.repos.d/somewhere.repo" do
      source "http://somewhere.example.com/yum/el5/somewhere.repo"
      owner "root"
      group "root"
      mode 0644
    end

    package "gecode-devel"
