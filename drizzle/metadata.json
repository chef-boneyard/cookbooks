You'll need to have the C compiler and such (ie, build-essential on Ubuntu) before running the recipes, but we already do that when installing Chef :-).\n\nOn server nodes,\n\n  include_recipe \"drizzle::server\"\n\nThe client recipe is already included by server and 'default' recipes.\n\n= LICENSE and AUTHOR:\n\nAuthor:: Padraig O'Sullivan (<osullivan.padraig@gmail.com>)\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
