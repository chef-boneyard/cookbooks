Description
===========

Lightweight resource and provider to install OS X applications (.app) from dmg files.

Changes
=======

## v0.7.0:

* [COOK-854] - use `cp -R` instead of `cp -r`
* [COOK-855] - specify a file or directory to check for prior install

## v0.6.0:

* option to install software that is an .mpkg inside a .dmg
* ignore failure on chmod in case mode is already set, or is root owned

Requirements
============

## Platform:

* Mac OS X

Resources and Providers
=======================

dmg\_package
------------

This resource will install a DMG "Package". It will retrieve the DMG from a remote URL, mount it using OS X's `hdid`, copy the application (.app directory) to the specified destination (/Applications), and detach the image using `hdiutil`. The dmg file will be stored in the `Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]`. If you want to install an application that has already been downloaded (not using the `source` parameter), copy it to the appropriate location. You can find out what directory this is with the following command on the node to run chef:

    knife exec -E 'p Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]' -c /etc/chef/client.rb

Optionally, the LWRP can install an "mpkg" package using installer(8).

# Actions:

* :install - Installs the application.

# Parameter attributes:

* `app` - This is the name of the application used by default for the /Volumes directory and the .app directory copied to /Applications.
* `source` - remote URL for the dmg to download if specified. Default is nil.
* `destination` - directory to copy the .app into. Default is /Applications.
* `checksum` - sha256 checksum of the dmg to download. Default is nil.
* `type` - type of package, "app" or "mpkg". Default is "app". When using "mpkg", the destination must be /Applications.
* `volumes_dir` - Directory under /Volumes where the dmg is mounted. Not all dmgs are mounted into a /Volumes location matching the name of the dmg. If not specified, this will use the name attribute.
* `dmg_name` - Specify the name of the dmg if it is not the same as `app`, or if the name has spaces.

Usage Examples
==============

Install `/Applications/Tunnelblick.app` from the primary download site.

    dmg_package "Tunnelblick" do
      source "http://tunnelblick.googlecode.com/files/Tunnelblick_3.1.2.dmg"
      checksum "a3fae60b6833175f32df20c90cd3a3603a"
      action :install
    end

Install Google Chrome. Uses the `dmg_name` because the application name has spaces. Installs in `/Applications/Google Chrome.app`.

    dmg_package "Google Chrome" do
      dmg_name "googlechrome"
      source "https://dl-ssl.google.com/chrome/mac/stable/GGRM/googlechrome.dmg"
      checksum "7daa2dc5c46d9bfb14f1d7ff4b33884325e5e63e694810adc58f14795165c91a"
      action :install
    end

Install Dropbox. Uses `volumes_dir` because the mounted directory is different than the name of the application directory. Installs in `/Applications/Dropbox.app`.

    dmg_package "Dropbox" do
      volumes_dir "Dropbox Installer"
      source "http://www.dropbox.com/download?plat=mac"
      checksum "b4ea620ca22b0517b75753283ceb82326aca8bc3c86212fbf725de6446a96a13"
      action :install
    end

Install MacIrssi to `~/Applications` from the local file downloaded to the cache path into an Applications directory in the current user's home directory. Chef should run as a non-root user for this.

    directory "#{ENV['HOME']}/Applications"

    dmg_package "MacIrssi" do
      destination "#{ENV['HOME']}/Applications"
      action :install
    end

Install Virtualbox to `/Applications` from the .mpkg:

    dmg_package "Virtualbox" do
      source "http://dlc.sun.com.edgesuite.net/virtualbox/4.0.8/VirtualBox-4.0.8-71778-OSX.dmg"
      type "mpkg"
    end

To do
=====

A few things remain outstanding to make this cookbook "1.0" quality.

* support downloading a .dmg.zip and unzipping it
* specify a local .dmg already downloaded in another location (like ~/Downloads)

Some things that would be nice to have at some point.

* use hdiutil to mount/attach the disk image
* automatically detect the `volumes_dir` where the image is attached
* be able to automatically accept license agreements
