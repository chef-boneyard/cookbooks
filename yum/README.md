Description
===========

Configures various YUM components on Red Hat-like systems.  Includes LWRP for managing repositories and their GPG keys.

Based on the work done by Eric Wolfe and Charles Duffy on the yumrepo cookbook. http://github.com/atomic-penguin/cookbooks/tree/yumrepo/yumrepo

Changes
=======

## v.0.1.2:

* Remove yum update in default recipe, that doesn't update caches, it
  updates packages installed.

Requirements
============
RHEL, CentOS or Scientific Linux 5.x or newer. It has not been tested on other platforms or earlier versions. RHEL 6 support is untested (testing and patches are welcome).

Recipes
=======

default
-------
The default recipe runs `yum update` during the Compile Phase of the Chef run to ensure that the system's package cache is updated with the latest. It is recommended that this recipe appear first in a node's run list (directly or through a role) to ensure that when installing packages, Chef will be able to download the latest version available on the remote YUM repository.

yum
---
Manages the configuration of the `/etc/yum.conf` via attributes.

Resources/Providers
===================

key
---
This LWRP handles importing GPG keys for YUM repositories. Keys can be imported by the `url` parameter or placed in `/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/` by a recipe and then installed with the LWRP without passing the URL.

# Actions
- :add: installs the GPG key into `/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/`
- :remove: removes the GPG key from `/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/`

# Attribute Parameters

- key: name attribute. The name of the GPG key to install.
- url: if the key needs to be downloaded, the URL providing the download.

# Example

``` ruby
# add the Zenoss GPG key
yum_key "RPM-GPG-KEY-zenoss" do
  url "http://dev.zenoss.com/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-zenoss"
  action :add
end
    
# remove Zenoss GPG key
yum_key "RPM-GPG-KEY-zenoss" do
  action :remove
end
```

repository
----------
This LWRP provides an easy way to manage additional YUM repositories. GPG keys can be managed with the `key` LWRP.

# Actions

- :add: creates a repository file and builds the repository listing
- :remove: removes the repository file

# Attribute Parameters

- repo_name: name attribute. The name of the channel to discover
- description. The description of the repository
- url: The URL providing the packages
- mirrorlist: Default is `false`,  if `true` the `url` is considered a list of mirrors
- key: Optional, the name of the GPG key file installed by the `key` LWRP.
- enabled: Default is `1`, set to `0` if the repository is disabled.
- type: Optional, alternate type of repository
- failovermethod: Optional, failovermethod
- bootstrapurl: Optional, bootstrapurl

# Example

``` ruby
# add the Zenoss repository
yum_repository "zenoss" do
  name "Zenoss Stable repo"
  url "http://dev.zenoss.com/yum/stable/"
  key "RPM-GPG-KEY-zenoss"
  action :add
end
    
# remove Zenoss repo
yum_repository "zenoss" do
  action :remove
end
```

Usage
=====

Put `recipe[yum]` first in the run list to ensure `yum update` is run before other recipes. You can manage GPG keys either with cookbook_file in a recipe if you want to package it with a cookbook or use the `url` parameter of the `key` LWRP.
