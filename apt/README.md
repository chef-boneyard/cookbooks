Description
===========

Configures various APT components on Debian-like systems.  Also includes a LWRP.

Recipes
=======

default
-------
The default recipe runs apt-get update during the Compile Phase of the Chef run to ensure that the system's package cache is updated with the latest. It is recommended that this recipe appear first in a node's run list (directly or through a role) to ensure that when installing packages, Chef will be able to download the latest version available on the remote APT repository.

This recipe also sets up a local cache directory for preseeding packages.

cacher
------
Installs the apt-cacher package and service so the system can provide APT caching. You can check the usage report at http://{hostname}:3142/report. The cacher recipe includes the `cacher-client` recipe, so it helps seed itself.

cacher-client
-------------
Configures the node to use the apt-cacher server as a client.

Resources/Providers
===================

This cookbook contains an LWRP, `apt_repository`, which provides the `add` and `remove` actions for managing additional software repositories with entries in the `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` directory. The LWRP also supports passing in a `key` and `keyserver` as attributes.

* `add` takes a number of attributes and creates a repository file and builds the repository listing.
* `remove` deletes the `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/#{new_resource.repo_name}-sources.list` file identified by the `repo_name` passed as the resource name.

Usage
=====

Put `recipe[apt]` first in the run list. If you have other recipes that you want to use to configure how apt behaves, like new sources, notify the execute resource to run, e.g.:

    template "/etc/apt/sources.list.d/my_apt_sources.list" do
      notifies :run, resources(:execute => "apt-get update"), :immediately
    end

The above will run during execution phase since it is a normal template resource, and should appear before other package resources that need the sources in the template.

Put `recipe[apt::cacher]` in the run_list for a server to provide APT caching and add `recipe[apt::cacher-client]` on the rest of the Debian-based nodes to take advantage of the caching server.

An example of The LWRP `apt_repository` `add` action:

    apt_repository "zenoss" do
      uri "http://dev.zenoss.org/deb"
      distribution "main"
      components ["stable"]
      action :add
    end

and the `remove` action:

    apt_repository "zenoss" do
      action :remove
    end
