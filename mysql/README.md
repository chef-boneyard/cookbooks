Description
===========

Installs and configures MySQL client or server.

Changes
=======

### v1.0.5:

* [COOK-465] allow optional remote root connections to mysql
* [COOK-455] improve platform version handling
* externalize conf_dir attribute for easier cross platform support
* change datadir attribute to data_dir for consistency

### v1.0.4:

* fix regressions on debian platform
* [COOK-578] wrap root password in quotes
* [COOK-562] expose all tunables in my.cnf


Requirements
============

Platform
--------

* Debian, Ubuntu
* CentOS, Red Hat, Fedora

Tested on:

* Debian 5.0
* Ubuntu 10.04
* CentOS 5.5

Cookbooks
---------

Requires Opscode's openssl cookbook for secure password generation.

Requires a C compiler and Ruby development package in order to build mysql gem with native extensions. On Debian and Ubuntu systems this is satisfied by installing the "build-essential" and "ruby-dev" packages before running Chef. See USAGE below for information on how to handle this during a Chef run.

Resources and Providers
=======================

The cookbook contains a LWRP, `mysql_database` which can be used to manage databases through calls to the MySQL API. The mysql gem is installed to make this usable. The provider currently supports three actions:

* `flush_tables_with_read_lock` - sends the sql command "flush tables with read lock", used for setting up mysql master/slave replication.
* `unflush_tables` - sends the sql command "unflush tables", used for setting up master/slave replication.
* `create_db` - specify a database to be created.
* `query` - send an arbitrary query to the database, this should be used with care. Pass the SQL statement to use with the `sql` resource attribute.

For example see the USAGE section below.

Attributes
==========

* `mysql['server_root_password']` - Set the server's root password with this, default is a randomly generated password with `OpenSSL::Random.random_bytes`.
* `mysql['server_repl_password']` - Set the replication user 'repl' password with this, default is a randomly generated password with `OpenSSL::Random.random_bytes`.
* `mysql['server_debian_password']` - Set the debian-sys-maint user password with this, default is a randomly generated password with `OpenSSL::Random.random_bytes`.
* `mysql['bind_address']` - Listen address for MySQLd, default is node's ipaddress.
* `mysql['data_dir']` - Location for mysql data directory, default is "/var/lib/mysql"
* `mysql['conf_dir']` - Location for mysql conf directory, default is "/etc/mysql"
* `mysql['ec2_path']` - location of mysql data_dir on EC2 nodes, default "/mnt/mysql"

Performance tuning attributes, each corresponds to the same-named parameter in my.cnf; default values listed

* `mysql['tunable']['key_buffer']`          = "250M"
* `mysql['tunable']['max_connections']`     = "800"
* `mysql['tunable']['wait_timeout']`        = "180"
* `mysql['tunable']['net_write_timeout']`   = "30"
* `mysql['tunable']['net_write_timeout']`   = "30"
* `mysql['tunable']['back_log']`            = "128"
* `mysql['tunable']['table_cache']`         = "128"
* `mysql['tunable']['max_heap_table_size']` = "32M"

Usage
=====

On client nodes,

    include_recipe "mysql::client"

This will install the MySQL client libraries and development headers on the system. It will also install the Ruby Gem `mysql`, so that the cookbook's LWRP (above) can be used. This is done during the compile-phase of the Chef run. On platforms that are known to have a native package (currently Debian, Ubuntu, Red hat, Centos, Fedora and SUSE), the package will be installed. Other platforms will use the RubyGem.

This creates a resource object for the package and does the installation before other recipes are parsed. You'll need to have the C compiler and such (ie, build-essential on Ubuntu) before running the recipes, but we already do that when installing Chef :-). If you want to be able to access a MySQL database via Ruby within another recipe, you could do so, like so:

    mysql_database "create application_production database" do
      host "localhost"
      username "root"
      password node[:mysql][:server_root_password]
      database "application_production"
      action :create_db
    end

This will connect to the MySQL server running on localhost as "root" and password as `mysql[:server_root_password]` attribute (see below) and create the database specified with the `database` parameter. The provider will attempt to determine whether the database exists first.

On server nodes,

    include_recipe "mysql::server"

On Debian and Ubuntu, this will preseed the mysql-server package with the randomly generated root password from the attributes file. On other platforms, it simply installs the required packages. It will also create an SQL file, /etc/mysql/grants.sql, that will be used to set up grants for the root, repl and debian-sys-maint users.

On EC2 nodes,

    include_recipe "mysql::server_ec2"

When the `ec2_path` doesn't exist we look for a mounted filesystem (eg, EBS) and move the data_dir there.

The client recipe is already included by server and 'default' recipes.
