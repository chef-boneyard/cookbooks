Recipes

default
-------

Installs nscd, manages the nscd service and makes available commands
to clear the nscd databases (passwd and group) so they can be notified
in other recipes (such as when managing openldap).

Usage
=====

If you're using nscd, add this recipe. If you need to notify the clear
commands, e.g.,

    cookbook_file "/etc/nsswitch.conf" do
      source "nsswitch.conf"
      notifies :run, "execute[nscd-clear-passwd]", :immediately
      notifies :run, "execute[nscd-clear-group]", :immediately
    end
