Attributes
==========

* `node["java"]["install_flavor"]` - Type of JRE you would like installed ("sun" or "openjdk"), default "openjdk".

Usage
=====

Simply include the recipe where you want Java installed.

If you would like to use the Sun flavor of Java, create a role and set the `java[install_flavor]` attribute to `'sun'`.  

    % knife role show java
    {
      "name": "java",
      "chef_type": "role",
      "json_class": "Chef::Role",
      "default_attributes": {
        "java": {
          "install_flavor":"sun"
        }
      },
      "description": "",
      "run_list": [
        "recipe[java]"
      ],
      "override_attributes": {
      }
    }

The Sun flavor of Java is only supported on Debian and Ubuntu systems, the recipe will preseed the package and update java alternatives.
