Description
===========

Installs haproxy and prepares the configuration location.

Changes
=======

## v1.0.0:

* Use `node.chef_environment` instead of `node['app_environment']`

Requirements
============

## Platform

Tested on Ubuntu 8.10 and higher.

## Cookbooks:

Attributes
==========

* `node['haproxy']['member_port']` - the port that member systems will be listening on, default 80
* `node['haproxy']['enable_admin']` - whether to enable the admin interface. default true. Listens on port 22002.
* `node['haproxy']['app_server_role']` - used by the `app_lb` recipe to search for a specific role of member systems. Default `webserver`.

Usage
=====

Use either the default recipe or the `app_lb` recipe.

When using the default recipe, modify the haproxy.cfg.erb file with listener(s) for your sites/servers.

The app_lb recipe is designed to be used with the application cookbook, and provides search mechanism to find the appropriate application servers. Set this in a role that includes the haproxy::app_lb recipe. For example,

    name "load_balancer"
    description "haproxy load balancer"
    run_list("recipe[haproxy::app_lb]")
    override_attributes(
      "haproxy" => {
        "app_server_role" => "webserver"
      }
    )

The search uses the node's `chef_environment`. For example, create `environments/production.rb`, then upload it to the server with knife

    % cat environments/production.rb
    name "production"
    description "Nodes in the production environment."
    % knife environment from file production.rb
